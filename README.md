Title:

# [Your Flask API Name]
Description:

A brief description of your Flask API's functionality and purpose. Explain what problem it solves or what data it provides access to.
Table of Contents (Optional, for larger projects):

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Endpoints](#endpoints)
* [Development](#development)
* [Deployment](#deployment)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [License](#license)
Installation:

If your project has specific installation instructions (requirements, configuration), explain them here.
Include a badge or link to any dependencies users need to install.
Usage:

Provide an overview of how users can interact with your API.
Document any authentication or authorization requirements.
Consider adding usage examples using tools like curl or Python's requests library.
Endpoints:

List all available API endpoints with their HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Describe the request and response formats (JSON, XML, etc.) for each endpoint.
Explain the purpose of each endpoint and what data it accepts or returns.
Development:

Outline how to set up a development environment locally.
Mention any specific commands (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt) or configurations needed to run the API.
Explain how to run tests and debugging processes.
Deployment:

Include a section dedicated to deployment using GitHub Actions and AWS EKS.
Explain the prerequisites for using this deployment pipeline (e.g., AWS account, EKS cluster setup).
Provide a high-level overview of the steps involved in the deployment process without exposing specific secrets. You can mention using environment variables for credentials and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
Important: Avoid including sensitive information like AWS access keys or Terraform state files in your public repository! Reference how to configure these securely in your GitHub Actions workflow.
Contributing (Optional):

If you welcome contributions, explain the guidelines and process for submitting code changes.


Here are some additional details to consider including in your README based on how you've structured your project and API:

Error codes: Document any specific error codes your API might return and their meanings.
Docker Image (Optional): If you're building a Docker image for deployment, provide instructions on how to customize or build it locally.
Configuration (Optional): If your API requires configuration files or environment variables, explain their content and usage.
Integration with GitHub Actions:

While you don't want to expose sensitive details within the README itself, you can mention the integration with GitHub Actions in a brief and secure way. Here's an example:

## Deployment

This project leverages GitHub Actions to automate deployment to AWS EKS. Refer to the workflow YAML file (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml) for a high-level overview of the deployment process. Setting up the CI/CD pipeline requires specific configuration (AWS credentials, Terraform state, etc.). Please consult the documentation for creating a secure workflow and leveraging environment variables for sensitive information.
